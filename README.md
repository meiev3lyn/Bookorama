# Bookorama
This is a library project, where you can keep track of the books you read. There are books inserted by default, if you'd like to read them or you already did , you can add them in your reading list, if you don't, you can insert your own books and add them to your reading list.
You can delete books you don't want permanantly. You can delete all the books too if you'd like as well as hiding them from sight.
The reading list keeps track of your reading pattern, it contains the books you've read and those you plan to read.
You can also search for your desired books if there are too many books to look through. If you don't find the book you want, you can always add it.

This group project is made by two web development students: 
Hasna Amal & Ouissal Akramou
